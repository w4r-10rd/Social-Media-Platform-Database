# Social-Media-Platform-Database
# About‚ùì
<ul>
<li>We are building a foundational social media database structure with this project that can be readily integrated with a front-end UI. </li>
<li>In this case, we are handling the information of several people, including their followers, interests, and public social media platform activity, which includes bookmarks, hashtags followed, comments, and likes on posts, among many other things. </li>
<li>We were able to clearly describe the connections and relationships between various social media activities using our SQL query. </li>
<li>Using this database, we have attempted to get and store the data in its original storage form, as shown in (img/videos in url). </li>
